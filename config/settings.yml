# Hi there!
# These are the settings for Selfstarter.
# This is more tidy than changing the HTML if all you want to do is rename things and swap out images

# You should totally change the HTML and CSS though
# Checkout app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss to change around the CSS quickly

# Set your project goal here - if you manually want to adjust your progress to test the site, head over to the Order model (app/models/order.rb)

# This'll be both the page title (<title></title>) and the name in the header
product_name: "Wayki, the World's First Alarm Clock Toothbrush"

# An image showcasing your product -- it'll show up when you pin your product

# If you want to change the images for the key points (e.g. "Kickstarter is not a store")
# They're in app/assets/images/#{pointer_number}-background.png
# So, the first key point, it's at app/assets/images/1-background.png
# Alternatively, change it up in app/assets/stylesheets/homepage/key_points.css.scss
