          <summary class=''>How do you want to use the money?</summary>
          <p>We are looking for the funds to invest in the expensive stages of a hardware startup - production, injection moulding and economy of scale. </p>

          <summary>Why are you the right people for this project?</summary>
          <p>I created/designed Wayki myself, I have built a great working relationship with a reputable engineering company, who have already proven their expertise with the business relationships we've made in China.</p>

          <summary>What happens if I can't disable Wayki?</summary>
         <p>We have some plans ahead but currently there are two options:
<br>
1. If there's a chance that your bathroom will be engaged when you get up, leave the brush in another room which you have access to. (No, not your bedroom - too easy.)
<br>
2. If we have a good return on Kickstarter we'll package every Wayki order with a second brush - one for the bathroom and one as a backup.</p>

          <summary class=''>What is the best way to use Wayki (in a nutshell?)</summary>
           <p>The key to efficient mornings is preparation - make the important decisions the night before and you will flow into the day ahead. It's all about reducing decision-making.
<br>
<br>
For a super quick start, a great approach is to leave your clothes in the bathroom before you go to bed at night. This way, you're straight in the bathroom and can come out ready for that morning exercise!</p>

          <summary>Is Wayki going to get my child/younger sibling to brush their teeth?</summary>
            <p>You bet! We've already done tests with this (not extensive) and after several days the habit sets in. The beauty of Wayki is that it creates good habits without any thought required, for chores that have historically required a little self motivation.<br>
The secret to getting anyone to do anything that isn't fun is to help them (1) understand the benefit, then (2) remove as much friction as possible. That's our philosophy anyway!<br>

          <summary class=''>Is Wayki available in large multiples? (Distributors)</summary>
           <p>Certainly. Let us know how many Wayki's you'd like in multiples of 10 or 100, and we'll offer you a discount. You can get in touch with us with a quick <a href="mailto:contact@wayki.co" target="_blank">email</a>.</p>

          <summary class=''>I don't want to run out of bedroom scantily clad!?</summary>
          <p>Well get some pajamas! If you want momentum in the morning you can't be thinking about how you look first thing. Listen, you really should stop sleeping naked, ok? Yes, we do know.

          <summary>What will I do about replacement brushes?</summary>
          <p>Our brushes will be available via the main website (<a href="http://wayki.co" target="_blank">Wayki.co</a>) soon after Wayki has been ratcheted up to mass production. That's all we can reveal at this point but we can say the following:
<br>- Affordable price point, competing with the cost of existing electric toothbrush heads
<br>- New designs will be introduced as time goes on plus added personalisation options will be considered if there is demand.
<br>- Subscriptions will be available at our subscription store. Brushes will be conveniently delivered straight to your door!
