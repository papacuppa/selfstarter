          <p>Now that we have proven the Wayki Connect concept we want the funds to develop the other  more traditional functionality (which have already been designed), and scale up to mass production so we can start spreading the morning love around the world with Wayki.</p>

           <summary>Why are you the right people for this project?</summary>
          <p>I created/designed Wayki myself, I have built a great working relationship with a reputable  engineering company, who have already proven their expertise with development of our prototype model.</p>

         <summary>How long will it be until I get my hands on a Wayki?</summary>
          <p>Broadly speaking, we already have a physical prototype and have identified the factories we will be using in China. We're also preparing the PCB for production but the main time consuming process lies with getting the professional moulds developed. We're estimating 3 - 5 months for batch 1 (determined by number of pre-orders)</p>

          <summary>How do I change around the images, product name, etc?</summary>
          <p>The best way is in <code>config/settings.yml</code>. It has variables for several different parts, the video, the product name, the call to action button ("Fork Now"), and several more.

          <summary>How do I change the CSS?</summary>
          <p>Head over to <code>app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss</code>. It makes it easy to change around the elements used throughout the HTML.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alternatively, you can dive right into the CSS, have a look at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/main.css.scss</code>.</p>

          <summary>Why did you release this?</summary>
          <p>Hardware startups are less welcome on Kickstarter than they were 6 months ago. We needed to roll our own kickstarter, so we did. Other hardware startups probably will too, so we made it easier for them by open sourcing our way of doing it.</p>

          <summary class=''>What software stack does this use?</summary>
          <p>It's a Ruby on Rails app that makes heavy use of SCSS, Kickstarter's wonderful <code>amazon_flex_pay</code> gem, and a hint of CoffeeScript.</p>
