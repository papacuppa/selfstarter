		  We are looking for the funds to invest into the early stage of our startup. Specifically, that's injection moulding and production to the point of tapping into the economies of scale - the economy of scale gives us the cashflow to reinvest back into the company. Specifically, that's inventory, hiring, marketing and R&D.

		   I created/designed Wayki myself, but I could only go so far in my garage. I've built a great working relationship with a reputable engineering company who have already proven their value with the business relationships we've made in China. They will oversee eco-friendliness, quality control, operational issues, assembly, packaging, and finally shipping. Centralising the operations reduces time-to-market so people can get Waykified sooner, rather than later.</p>

          <h6>
		  <font size="2">
		  
		  We have some plans ahead but currently there are two options:
<br>
<br>
1. If there's a chance that your bathroom will be engaged when you get up, leave the brush in another room which you have access to. (No, not your bedroom - too easy.)
<br>
<br>
2. If we have a good return on our crowdfund, we'll package every Wayki with a second brush - one for the bathroom and one as a backup.</p>

          <summary class=''>What is the best way to use Wayki? (In a nutshell.)</summary>
            <h6>
		  <font size="2">
		  
		  The key to efficient mornings is preparation - make the important decisions the night before and you will flow into the day ahead. It's all about reducing decision-making.
<br>
<br>
For a super quick start, a great approach is to leave your clothes in the bathroom before you go to bed at night. This way, you're straight in the bathroom and can come out ready for that morning exercise!</p>

          <summary>Is Wayki going to get my child/younger sibling to brush their teeth?</summary>
             <h6>
		  <font size="2">
		  
		  We've already done tests with this (not extensively) and immediately, the habit sets in. The beauty of Wayki is that it creates good habits without any thought required, for chores that have generally required a little self motivation.<br>
<br>
			The secret to getting anyone to do anything that isn't fun is to help them (1) understand the benefit, then (2) remove as much friction as possible. That's our philosophy anyway!<br>

		  Our brushes will be available via the main website (<a href="http://wayki.co" target="_blank">Wayki.co</a>) soon after Wayki has been ratcheted up to mass production. That's all we can reveal at this point but we can say the following:
<br>
<br>- Affordable price point, competing with the cost of existing electric toothbrush heads
<br>
<br>- New designs will be introduced as time goes on plus added personalisation options will be considered if there is demand.
<br>
<br>- Subscriptions will be available at our subscription store. Brushes will be conveniently delivered straight to your door!
