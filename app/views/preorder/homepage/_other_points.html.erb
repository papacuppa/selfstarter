      <p>One of the reasons we went the crowdfunding route was 
because it's a great way to engage people and encourage
conversation. Make the internet that bit more social and
head over to <a href="http://wayki.co">Wayki.co</a> for our live blog!</p>

      <p>The 29 day launch of Wayki has many moving parts and will
be evolving fast. Once again, to stay up to date head over 
to the blog. I recommend you sign up to the newsletter so you don't miss a
beat. (We've also got an <a href="http://wayki.co/blogs/blog.atom">RSS feed.)</a></p>

      <h3><font size="6.5"><p align="center">How This Works</h3></font></p>
      <p>Crowdfunding is a democratic and social approach to funding 
ideas. (Like a startup company). Kickstarter has popularised
this movement and it has only just begun. Customers are only
charged if the funding goal is reached before the campaign ends.</p>
