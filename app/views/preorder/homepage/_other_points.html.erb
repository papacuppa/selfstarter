      <p>One of the reasons we went the crowdfunding route was 
because it’s a great way to engage people and encourage
conversation. Make the internet that bit more social and
head over to Wayki.co for our blog!</p>

      <p>The 37 day launch of Wayki has many moving parts and will

      <h3><font size="6.5"><p align="center">How This Works</h3></font></p>
      <p>Crowdfunding is a democratic & social approach to funding 
ideas. (Like a startup company). Kickstarter has popularised
this movement and it’s only just begun. Customers are only
charged if the funding goal is reached before the campaign ends.</p>

      <h3><font size="6.5"><p align="center">About Us</h3></font></p>
      <p>We are a small team of designers, engineers and entrepreneurs looking for big challenges that can make at least a 
modest dent in the universe. Our goal is to create products
that people can no longer imagine living without. Simple.</p>
