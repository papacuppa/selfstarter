because it's a great way to engage people and encourage
conversation. Make the internet that bit more social and

      <h7>
		  <font size="4">
		  Crowdfunding is a democratic and social app-<br>
roach to funding ideas. (Like a startup company).
Kickstarter has popularised this movement and it
has only just begun. If funded, the project creator
then has the resources to deliver on the promise.
